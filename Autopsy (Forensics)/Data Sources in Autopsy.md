**Data Sources in Autopsy**

When adding a data source to an Autopsy case, understanding the supported types is crucial. Autopsy can handle a variety of data sources, each requiring specific processing techniques. 

**Supported Data Source Types:**

1. **Disc Image or VM File:**
   * A bit-for-bit copy of a hard drive, media card, or virtual machine.
   * Often used for comprehensive forensic analysis.
2. **Local Disc:**
   * A physical storage device, such as a hard drive or USB drive.
   * Useful for analyzing devices directly connected to the system.
3. **Logical Files and Folders:**
   * A collection of files and folders without the underlying file system structure.
   * Suitable for analyzing specific files or folders of interest.
4. **Allocated Space Image Files:**
   * File system images that contain only the allocated space, excluding unallocated space.
   * Useful for focusing on active data and potentially recovering deleted files.
5. **Autopsy Logical Imager Results:**
   * Results from using Autopsy's built-in logical imager to create a logical image of a device.
6. **XRY Text Export:**
   * Text exports from XRY, a mobile device forensic analysis tool.
   * Used to analyze data extracted from mobile devices.
