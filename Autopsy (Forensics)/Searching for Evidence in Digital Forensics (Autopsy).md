"**Searching for Evidence in Digital Forensics**

One of the fundamental tasks in digital forensics is searching for specific data. Today, I'll demonstrate how to conduct a keyword search in Autopsy, a popular digital forensics software suite.

**Setting Up the Case**

 **Create a New Case:** Start by creating a new case in Autopsy. Give it a name (e.g., '001') and choose a base directory.
 
 **Load the Image:** Next, load the disk image you want to analyze. Select the image file (e.g., 'usbimage.001') and follow the on-screen prompts.

**Exploring Deleted Files**

Once the image is loaded, you can explore its file system. Notice the files marked with an 'X'. These are deleted files that Autopsy can recover. 

* **Recovering a Deleted File:** To recover a deleted file, right-click on it and select 'Extract Files.' Choose a destination folder (e.g., your desktop) and save the file.

**Conducting a Keyword Search**

Now, let's perform a keyword search to locate files containing a specific term. 

1. **Initiate a Search:** Go to the 'Keyword Search' tab. 
2. **Enter the Keyword:** Type the keyword you want to search for (e.g., 'Bill').
3. **Start the Search:** Click 'Search.'

Autopsy will scan the image and display all files that match the keyword. This powerful search functionality is invaluable in digital forensics investigations and everyday computer use.
