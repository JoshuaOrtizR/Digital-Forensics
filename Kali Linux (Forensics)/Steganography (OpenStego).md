**Steganography: The Art of Hidden Messages**

Steganography is a technique that involves concealing information within another, seemingly innocent file. In the digital crimes, images are a common carrier for hidden messages. 

**Functionality**

1. **Pixel Manipulation:** Digital images are composed of pixels, each represented by a combination of red, green, and blue color values. 
2. **Binary Representation:** These color values are stored in binary format (0s and 1s).
3. **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography:** By modifying the least significant bit of each pixel, we can embed additional information without significantly altering the image's visual appearance. 
4. **Imperceptible Changes:** Since the human eye is less sensitive to slight color variations, these modifications often go unnoticed.

**Practical Demonstration with OpenStego**

OpenStego to demonstrate the process:

1. **Prepare the Secret Message:**
   * Create a text file (e.g., `message.txt`) containing the message you want to hide.

2. **Select the Cover Image:**
   * Choose an image file (e.g., `olives.png`) that will serve as the carrier for the hidden message.

3. **Open OpenStego:**
   * Launch the OpenStego application.
4. **Input the Message:**
   * In the "Message to Hide" field, browse to and select your `message.txt` file.

5. **Select the Cover Image:**
   * In the "Cover File" field, browse to and select your `olives.png` file.
6. **Specify the Stego Image:**
   * In the "Stego File" field, specify the desired output file name and path (e.g., `stego.png`).

7. **Optional Encryption:**
   * For added security, you can encrypt the secret message using a strong encryption algorithm like AES. Set a password for the encryption.
8. **Hide the Message:**
   * Click the "Hide Data" button to initiate the steganography process.

**Analyzing the Results**

Once the process is complete, you'll have a new image file (`stego.png`). Visually, it will appear identical to the original `olives.png` file. However, it now contains the hidden message.

**SecAdmin Notes:**

* **Steganography vs. Cryptography:** While cryptography scrambles data to make it unreadable, steganography conceals the very existence of the hidden message.
* **Limitations:** Steganography is not foolproof. Advanced techniques can be used to detect and extract hidden messages.
