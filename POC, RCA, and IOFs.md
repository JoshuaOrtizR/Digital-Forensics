**My overview about POC, RCA, and IOFs**

**POC:** Proof of Concept
* A demonstration of the posibility of a particular idea or approach.
  - Testing a new security tool or technique
  - Replicating a specific attack to understand its impact
  - Validating a proposed solution to a security issue

**RCA:** Root Cause Analysis
* A systematic process to identify the root cause of a problem or incident.
* This is used to determine the underlying reasons for a security breach, such as:
  - System vulnerabilities
  - Human error
  - Inadequate security controls
  - Malicious activity

**IOFs:** Indicators of Compromise
* Specific evidence or artifacts that indicate a system or network has been compromised.
* IOFs can take various forms, including:
  - Unusual network traffic
  - Malicious files
  - Registry modifications
  - Logs of unauthorized access

**SecAdmin Notes**

- **Incident Detection:** An IOF is detected, indicating a potential compromise.
- **Incident Investigation:** An RCA is initiated to determine the root cause of the compromise.
- **Remediation:** Based on the RCA findings, appropriate measures are taken to mitigate the risk, such as patching vulnerabilities, implementing stronger security controls, or removing malicious software.
- **Validation:** A POC might be conducted to test the effectiveness of the remediation steps.

POCs can be used to validate potential solutions identified during an RCA, while IOFs are the clues that trigger an investigation lead to a RCA.
