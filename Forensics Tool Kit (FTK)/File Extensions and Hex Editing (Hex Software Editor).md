**Understanding File Extensions and Hex Editing**

**The Problem:**
Often, malicious actors camouflage files by changing their extensions to mislead investigators. This can make it difficult to identify the true nature of a file. 

**Solution: Hex Editing**

Hex editing allows us to examine the raw binary data of a file, revealing its underlying structure and format. By analyzing the file header signature, we can often determine the correct file type, even if the extension is incorrect. 

1. **Identify the Suspicious File:**
   - In this case, we have a file named "secret.jpg." However, when we try to open it with a standard image viewer, it fails. This suggests that the file extension might be incorrect.

2. **Open the File in a Hex Editor:**
   - Use a hex editor like Neo to open the "secret.jpg" file.

3. **Analyze the File Header Signature:**
   - The initial bytes of a file, known as the file header signature, provide clues about the file format.
   - In our example, the file header signature is `50 4B 03 04 14 00 06 00`.

4. **Consult a Magic Table:**
   - A magic table is a database of file header signatures and their corresponding file types.
   - By comparing the file header signature to entries in a magic table, we can often identify the correct file type.

5. **Change the File Extension:**
   - Based on the information from the magic table, we can change the file extension to the correct one. 
   - In our case, the file header signature suggests that the file is a Microsoft Word document. So, we can rename the file to "secret.docx."

6. **Verify the File Type:**
   - Try opening the file with the new extension. If the file opens correctly, we've successfully identified the original file type.

**SecAdmin Notes:**

- **Hex editors are tools for digital forensics.** They allow us to examine the raw binary data of a file, which can be invaluable for uncovering hidden information.
- **File header signatures are unique identifiers for different file formats.** By analyzing these signatures, you can often determine the correct file type, even if the extension is misleading.
- **Magic tables are a valuable resource for digital forensics.** They provide a database of file header signatures and their corresponding file types.
- **Always exercise caution when modifying files.** Incorrectly changing a file extension can damage the file. It's always best to make a copy of the original file before making any changes.
