**Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**

Those are sophisticated, long-lasting cyberattacks carried out by highly skilled attackers, often state-sponsored. These attacks are designed to infiltrate a target organization's network, steal sensitive data, and maintain persistent access over an extended period. 

**Functionality:**

 **Initial Access:**
   * **Phishing:** Attackers send targeted emails with malicious attachments or links, tricking victims into clicking and downloading malware.
   * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Attackers identify and exploit software vulnerabilities, such as unpatched systems or zero-day exploits.
   * **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers use automated tools to guess passwords and gain unauthorized access.

 **Persistence:** 
   * **Backdoors:** Attackers install hidden backdoors to maintain access, even after security measures are implemented.
   * **Rootkits:** Attackers use rootkits to gain administrative privileges and hide their presence.
   * **Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBins):** Attackers leverage legitimate system tools to execute malicious commands.

 **Lateral Movement:** 
   * **Network Mapping:** Attackers map the network to identify valuable targets.
   * **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers gain higher-level privileges to access sensitive systems.
   * **Credential Harvesting:** Attackers steal credentials to access additional accounts.

 **Data Exfiltration:** 
   * **Data Theft:** Attackers steal sensitive data, such as intellectual property, financial information, or customer data.
   * **Data Destruction:** Attackers may destroy or corrupt data to cause disruption or damage.

 **Command and Control (C&C):**
   * **Communication Channels:** Attackers establish covert communication channels to receive commands and send stolen data.
   * **C&C Servers:** Attackers use C&C servers to coordinate attacks and maintain persistence.

**SecAdmin Notes:**

**Characteristics of APTs:**

* **Stealth:** APTs are designed to evade detection by security tools.
* **Persistence:** Attackers maintain long-term access to target systems.
* **Targeted Attacks:** APTs are often targeted at specific organizations or industries.
* **Highly Skilled Attackers:** APTs are carried out by highly skilled and experienced attackers.

**Defending Against APTs:**

* **Strong Security Posture:** Implement robust security measures, including strong passwords, regular software updates, and network segmentation.
* **Employee Training:** Educate employees about phishing attacks and social engineering tactics.
* **Network Security Monitoring:** Use advanced security tools to detect and respond to threats.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan to minimize damage and recover from attacks.
* **Threat Intelligence:** Stay informed about the latest threats and vulnerabilities.
